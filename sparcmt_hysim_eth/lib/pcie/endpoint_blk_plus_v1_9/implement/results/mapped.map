Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,385 out of  17,280    8%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,582
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           766 out of   3,582   21%

    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,738 out of   3,582   48%
    Number of unique control sets:             221
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             489 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
