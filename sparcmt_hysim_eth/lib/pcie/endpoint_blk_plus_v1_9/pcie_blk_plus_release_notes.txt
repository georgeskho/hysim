2. New Features

   - ISE 10.1i SP3 software support
   - Added support for Virtex-5 TX150T and TX240T
   - Added support for ISE Project Navigator Flow.
   - Added support for Expansion ROM BAR. 
	This feature is now permanently enabled. 
	Users MUST respond to accesses to this BAR. 
	Please refer to the Endpoint Block Plus v1.9 for PCI Express User Guide,
	Chapter 3, section on Base Address Registers for further details.

3. Resolved Issues

   - Enabled Expansion ROM BAR.
      o CR 473951

      Removed workaround to disable Expansion ROM BAR, as this was causing data
      corruption with certain traffic patterns. This feature is now permanently
      enabled and cannot be disabled. Users will need to respond to accesses to
      this BAR. 
      Please refer to the Endpoint Block Plus v1.9 for PCI Express User Guide,
      Chapter 3, section on Base Address Registers for further details.

   - Tx Lockup due to SRL 16E power on initialization issue
      o CR 476758

      Issue resolved where the Transmit path of the core locks up due to a Power
      On Initialization Issue with the SRL 16E Calendar logic.

   - Update GTX wrapper
      o CR 471589

      Update the GTX wrapper to remove TXBUFFERBYPASS mode.

   - Tx lockup due to link partner advertising infinite data credits
      o CR 476757

      Issue resolved where a link partner advertising infinite data credits 
      caused the transmit path of the core to lock up.

   - Unexpected deassertion of trn_tdst_rdy_n in response to trn_tsrc_rdy_n 
     deassertion
      o CR 472508

     Issue resolved where deassertion of trn_tsrc_rdy_n causes trn_tdst_rdy_n
     deassertion.

   - Set Slot Clock bit in Link Status Register set incorrectly
      o CR 472342

      Selecting the Slot Clock Configuration option in the GUI does not 
      set the Set Slot Clock bit in the Link Status Register.

   - GUI Issue with Bar 3 configuration
      o CR 474746

      Issue resolved with GUI for Bar 3 configuration. When Bar 3 was selected
      for customization, the fields were not enabled for customization.

   - GUI Allowing 32 bit BAR to be set as Pre-fetchable
      o CR 437528

      Issue resolved where the GUI was allowing a BAR set as 32 bit BAR to also 
      be set as Pre-fetchable.

   - System Verilog compatibility
      o CR 473935

      Updated user application (pci_exp_usrapp_com.v) to be System Verilog 
      compatible.

   - False failure reporting in PIO tests resolved
      o CR 472801

      PIO tests fixed to resolve false failure reporting. These tests were 
      passing, however a failure was reported.

   - Data Corruption in example design test for 4 lane endpoint on FX70T
      o CR 474892

      Data corruption issue resolved in example design test for a 4 lane 
      endpoint on FX70T. 

   - Extra feedback BUFG removed from PLL clocking network.
      o CR 476165

      Removed extra feedback BUFG from the PLL clocking network. This BUFG is 
      redundant as the user clock in the core need not be edge aligned to the 
      reference clock input.

   - License Check Failure Warning issued while generating a core from CoreGen
      o CR 438737

      Issue resolved where the a Warning was being issued while generating the 
      core from CoreGen for a License Check failure.

4. Known Issues

    The following are known issues for v1.9 of this core at the time of release.

    4.1  Functional Issues

          - Transitioning to L0s can cause the core to lose BAR settings
	     o CR 471677

	     Transition of the Host and the Endpoint into L0s, causes the core
	     to lose BAR settings. This is an LXT/SXT only issue.

	  - TS2 link Upconfigure bit causing failure to link train
	     o CR 472244

	     Setting the Autonomous bit in a TS1 causes the Integrated Hard 
	     Block for PCI Express to fail to link train.

	  - TLP dropped on receive interface due to Completion Streaming Issue
	     o CR 473226

	     Completion TLP getting dropped on receive interface due to receiver
	     overflow when using Completion Streaming mode.

	  - Gui Settings to control GTX attributes do not match GTX spec
	     o CR 478312

	     GUI settings to control GTX attributes do not match the GTX
	     specification.
	     For correct settings, refer to the IP Release Notes Guide listed
	     below.


    4.2  Simulation Issues

          - Large Simulation Times
          o CR 448685

            Simulation takes a long time to achieve trn_lnk_up_n assertion.
	    This is because GTP model drives the serial lines to Unknown logic
	    state, when signaling Electrical Idle during the link training 
	    phase. Refer to Xilinx Answer 29294 for a work around to this issue.

    4.3  Implementation Issues

          - Speed file and design changes

            The design files present in this release are based on timing 
	    parameters from, and intended for use with, the speed files shipped 
	    with ISE 10.1 SP2. As more device characterization data is collected,
	    Xilinx may update the speed files to more closely model device 
	    operation.

            Xilinx reserves the right to modify the design files, including the 
	    core pin-out, in order to maintain full compliance after speed files
	    updates occur. To the full extent possible, Xilinx will incorporate 
	    such modifications without using pin-out changes in an effort to 
	    provide "transparent" design file updates.

           - Timing Closure

            In order to obtain timing closure, designers may be required to use
            multiple PAR seeds and/or floorplanning. Using Multi-Pass Place and
            Route (MPPR), designers can try multiple cost tables in order to meet
            timing. Please see the Development System Reference Guide in the
            Software Manuals found at: http://www.xilinx.com/support/library.htm
	    for more information on using MPPR. Designers may also have to 
	    floorplan and add advanced placement constraints for both their 
	    design and the core to meet timing.

            - Xilinx warnings

            The Xilinx tools may issue various warnings, however no errors should
            occur.

   The most recent information, including known issues, workarounds and 
   resolutions for this version is provided in the IP Release Notes Guide located
